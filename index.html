            <p class="left" style="color:darkolivegreen"> My name is Jacob Parra and I am a Thinkful student. I am
                completely brand new
                to coding but have come to truly enjoy it. I currently reside in Charlotte, North Carolina
                but I am originally from Texas. I have lived here for about 20 years now and love this city.

        <img alt="old school style electric ghuitar" class="auto" src="images/guitar.jpg"
             style="width:500px;border-top-width: 3px;">
        <p class="left" style="color:darkolivegreen">I have always been one of those people who loves technology and
            always secretly wanted
            to be able to somehow be part of it. Now that I have the opportunity I am going to make the absolute best of
            it. I have been in construction for just about 18 years and owned
            a company for 2 of those years. I always was the first to arrive and last to leave. I moved up in every
            job I ever had and with that being said i think those same attributes will be transferable to web
            development.
            I have always been a part of great teams and know that it takes a village to make projects come together in
            the most
            efficient way possible. I have no problem putting in the work. I did it in college and was always in the top
            of my classes. I have a mind
            for learning new things and solving complex problems.

        <!--Here I broke the 2 ideas into 2 paragraphs-->
        <p class="left" style="color:darkolivegreen"> Outside of coding I am a longtime musician, I've played guitar for
            about 15 years now. I'm
            not the greatest but love playing.
            Charlotte is known as the mecca of disc golf so right now that is my main sport and I play it often.I have
            always been an athlete. I play most sports such as:
